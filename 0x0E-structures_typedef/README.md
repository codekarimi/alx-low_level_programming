#A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself\n
#A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad\n
#Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read\n
#A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of\n
