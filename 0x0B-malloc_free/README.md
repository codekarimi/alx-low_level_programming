#Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\n
#The woman who has no imagination has no wings
#He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life\n
#If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize\n
#It's not bragging if you can back it up\n
#It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe\n
